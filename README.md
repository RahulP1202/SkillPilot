Career guidance can be described as a process through which students become familiar with various career options, job opportunities and are prepared for those opportunities. Career counselling is the approach that will allow the student to understand his options, find his best skills and get acquainted with the world of work in order to make choices about employment, education and life.



Algorithm- KNN
K-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm is a type of supervised ML algorithm which can be used for both classification as well as regression predictive problems. 
The K-NN algorithm assumes the similarity between the new case/data and available cases and puts the new case into the category that is most similar to the available categories.
K-NN algorithm stores all the available data and classifies a new data point based on the similarity. This means when new data appears then it can be easily classified into a well suited category by using K- NN algorithm.
K-NN is a non-parametric algorithm, which means it does not make any assumption on underlying data.

Conclusion: 
 Summarize the overall impact and contribution of the project. The paper proposes a Career Guidance System which usesMachine Learning for Prediction. It is most effective andefficient System, which will be used by any Engineering Student of CS/IT(currently in final year or completed graduation) to evaluate their talent, skills and which particular Career path to choose from numerous Career paths available. This System is developed as per user requirement and provides an excellent user interface experience.
